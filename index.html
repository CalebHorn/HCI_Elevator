    <h3> Part C: Elevator at University Pointe</h3>

    <h3>Problems with this design:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>While the elevator is pretty good, the open and close buttons are not immediately identifiable. </li>
        <li>I believe that it would be better if the buttons were in a row vertically. </li>
        <li>Whether the elevator is going up or down is not displayed, which is a problem. </li>
        <li>I think that the 1st floor should be labeled the ground floor. </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Common Uses:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>    Hit a button to go to desired floor. </li>
        <li>    Hit a button to open door. </li>
        <li>    Hit a button to close door. </li>
        <li>    Display whether going up or down. </li>
        <li>    Display current floor. </li>
        <li>    The elevator should clearly display which direction it is going, what floor it is on, and what floor it is headed to. </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Elevator touch screen interface (Screen size - 768 x 1024): </h3>

    <h3>My thoughts on this design</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The floors are placed in ascending order from the ground floor to the sixth, as they do in the actual building.s</li>
        <li>Shows what is on the floor, so people know if they went to the wrong floor by mistake.</li>
        <li>The interface is simplistic, so as not to be confusing.</li>
        <li>The interface is similar to non touch screen interfaces, so should be easy to figure out.</li>
        <li>No way for the visualy impaired to know what to press.</li>
        <li>For a building with a lot of floors, this design would not work well.</li>
        </ul>
